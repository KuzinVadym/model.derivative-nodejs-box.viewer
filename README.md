Visit the [Forge Developer Portal](https://developer.autodesk.com), sign up for an account, then [create an app](https://developer.autodesk.com/myapps/create). For this new app, use <b>http://localhost:3000/api/forge/callback/oauth</b> as Callback URL. Finally take note of the <b>Client ID</b> and <b>Client Secret</b>.

You also need a Box Developer credentials. Visit the [Box Developer](https://developer.box.com), Log in or Sign up, follow the steps to [Create a Box Application](https://app.box.com/developers/services/edit/). For this new app, use <b>http://localhost:3000/api/box/callback/oauth</b> as redirect_uri. Finally, take note of the <b>client_id</b> and <b>client_secret</b>.

### Run locally

Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org).

Clone this project or download it. It's recommended to install [GitHub desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). To clone it via command line, use the following (<b>Terminal</b> on MacOSX/Linux, <b>Git Shell</b> on Windows):

    git clone https://github.com/autodesk-forge/model.derivative-nodejs-box.viewer

To run it, install the required packages, set the enviroment variables with your client ID & secret and finally start it. Via command line, navigate to the folder where this repository was cloned and use the following:

Mac OSX/Linux (Terminal)

    npm install
    export FORGE_CLIENT_ID=<<YOUR CLIENT ID FROM FORGE DEVELOPER PORTAL>>
    export FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET=<<YOUR FORGE CLIENT SECRET>>
    export BOX_CLIENT_ID=<<YOUR CLIENT ID FROM BOX DEVELOPER>>
    export BOX_CLIENT_SECRET=<<YOUR BOX CLIENT SECRET>>
    npm run dev

Windows (use <b>Node.js command line</b> from Start menu)

    npm install
    set FORGE_CLIENT_ID=<<YOUR CLIENT ID FROM FORGE DEVELOPER PORTAL>>
    set FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET=<<YOUR FORGE CLIENT SECRET>>
    set BOX_CLIENT_ID=<<YOUR CLIENT ID FROM BOX DEVELOPER>>
    set BOX_CLIENT_SECRET=<<YOUR BOX CLIENT SECRET>>
    npm run dev

Open the browser: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Packages used

All Autodesk Forge NPM packages are included by default, see complete list of what's available at [NPM website](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/keyword/autodesk). OAuth, Model Derivative and OSS are used. [Box SDK](https://docs.box.com/page/sdks) for NodeJS is [box-node-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/box-node-sdk). Some other non-Autodesk packaged are used, including [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) and its session/cookie middlewares ([express-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session) and [cookie-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cookie-parser)) for user session handling. The front-end uses [bootsrap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bootstrap) and [jquery](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jquery).

# Tips & tricks

For local development/testing, consider use [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) package, which auto restart your node application after any modification on your code. To install it, use:

    sudo npm install -g nodemon

Then, instead of <b>npm run dev</b>, use the following:

    npm run nodemon

Which executes <b>nodemon server.js --ignore www/</b>, where the <b>--ignore</b> parameter indicates that the app should not restart if files under <b>www</b> folder are modified.

## Troubleshooting

After installing Github desktop for Windows, on the Git Shell, if you see a <b>*error setting certificate verify locations*</b> error, use the following:

    git config --global http.sslverify "false"
